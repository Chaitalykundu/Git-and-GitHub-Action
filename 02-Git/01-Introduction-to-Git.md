# What is Git

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System** that tracks the changes in code over time, allows collaboration, and supports branching/merging means manage multiple version .sof a project .

&nbsp;

It's used to manage codebases locally and with remote services like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**.

It is a free and open source tool

It can be used within the DevOps workflows to maintain good version control.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# History

It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Why Git / Use of git

- Developers can work together (collab) from anywhere in the world
- Developers can see the full history of a project and Track code changes
- Developers can manage multiple versions of the project
- Developers can revert to earlier version of a project
- Track Who, What, When, Why made the changes

&nbsp;

# What does Git do

- **Manage projects** with Repositories
- **Clone** a project to work on a local copy
- Control and track changes with **Staging** and **Committing**
- **Branch and Merge** to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
- **Pull** the latest version of the project to a local copy
- **Push** local updates to the main project

# Features of Git

- If any file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered as **modified**

- Git allows to **track the full history** of every commit

- We can **revert back** in every version of previous commit

- We select the modified files we want to stage

- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit. but **keeps the track of changes** of made in each commit

- The staged files are committed , which prompts git to **store a permanent snapshot** of the files

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Steps to Work with Git

- Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository

- Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder

- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified

- You select the modified files you want to Stage

- The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files

- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.

- You can revert back to any previous commit.

- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
