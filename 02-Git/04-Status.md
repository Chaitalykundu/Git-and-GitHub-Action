# Git Status

We can check the **status** of any file using the `git status` command.

The `git status` command shows you what’s going on in your Git repository right now.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Purpose

It tells us

- Which branch you are on
- Which files have been modified
- Which files are staged (ready to commit)
- Which files are not staged
- Which files are untracked (new files not being tracked by Git)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Command

## full status

```bash
 git status
```

&nbsp;

### Example Output

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	newfile.txt
```

&nbsp;

## Short status

```bash
 git status -s
```

&nbsp;

### Example Output

```bash
$ git status -s
 M index.html
?? about.html
```

- `M` means index.html is modified (unstaged)
- `??` means about.html is untracked

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `modified:`                | File was changed but not staged                  |
| `untracked:`               | File is new and Git is not tracking it yet       |
| `Changes to be committed:` | These changes are **staged** and ready to commit |
