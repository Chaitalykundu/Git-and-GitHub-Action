# What is GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories online.

It allows developers to **store**, **share**, and **collaborate** on code using Git.

Github is the largest host of source code in the world

It has been owned by **Microsoft** since **2018**

Git is the tool

GitHub is the platform built around it.

# How GitHub Works

You create a Git repository locally using `git init`.

You push it to GitHub using `git remote add origin` ... + `git push`.

Other developers can collaborate, suggest changes, report issues, and contribute.
