# Atomic commit

n atomic commit is a commit that contains a single, complete, and coherent unit of work.

&nbsp;

In atomic commit, a commit should contain only one logical change.‚Äù

&nbsp;

It should be able to stand on its own, without depending on or affecting other commits. It should also have a clear and descriptive message that summarizes the changes made.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Meaning of unit of work

Here **unit of work** varies from person to person.

For example, if we are creating a webpage. To someone, unit of work may be creating only header. To someone unit of work may be creating some section. To someone, unit of work may be styling the font only and so on.

&nbsp;

# It should

- Do one thing only (fix one bug, add one feature, etc.)
- Be small and focused
- Be easily understandable
