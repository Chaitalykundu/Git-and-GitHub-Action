# VCS

VCS = Version Control System

&nbsp;

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps developers track changes to code over time, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of a project.

&nbsp;

Basically VCS keeps track on changes made on a particular software and take a snapshot of every modification along with the information like who made and what changes have been made.

Let’s suppose if a team of developer add some new functionalities in an application and the updated version is not working properly so as the version control system keeps track of our work so with the help of version control system we can omit the new changes and continue with the previous version.

&nbsp;

A separate branch is created for every contributor who made the changes and the changes aren’t merged into the original source code unless all are analyzed as soon as the changes are green signaled they merged to the main source code.

&nbsp;

# Benefits of the version control system

- Enhances the project development speed by providing efficient collaboration,

- Leverages the productivity, expedites product delivery, and skills of the employees through better communication and assistance,

- Reduce possibilities of errors and conflicts meanwhile project development through traceability to every small change,

- Employees or contributors of the project can contribute from anywhere irrespective of the different geographical locations through this VCS,

- For each different contributor to the project, a different working copy is maintained and not merged to the main file unless the working copy is validated. The most popular example is **Git**, **Helix core**, **Microsoft TFS**,

- Helps in recovery in case of any disaster or contingent situation,

- Informs us about Who, What, When, Why changes have been made.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Why use a VCS

- Tracks every change to code or files.
- Collaborates easily with multiple developers.
- Reverts to earlier versions if something breaks.
- Branches and merges code for features or bug fixes.

# Types of Version Control Systems

- Local Version Control Systems
- Centralized Version Control Systems
- Distributed Version Control Systems

&nbsp;

| Type                | Description                                        | Example                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Local VCS**       | Tracks changes only on local machine.              | RCS (Revision Control System) |
| **Centralized VCS** | Single central server stores all versions.         | SVN, CVS                      |
| **Distributed VCS** | Every developer has a full copy of the repository. | **Git**, Mercurial            |
